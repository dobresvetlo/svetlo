#svetlo
version 1.3

##Abstract
This is the ulti multi LED walrus crazy disco aka "svetlo"
(a project to light up some APA102 5050 LED strips using Raspberry Pi2 and Python)

##About
_Svetlo_ means _light_ in Czech. The aim of this project is to design an open-source simplest, fastest and cheapest way to drive digital LED strips via Raspberry PI from a video source. To substitute hardware for hundreds of Euros with a cheaper one with a free and open-source code.
There are two reasons we are using STRING data format (0xffffff with a | divider) over UDP/IP:
- in the future it may be easily stored and read from a file (CSV/TXT) - to have ready-to-use "programs" available
- the Adafruit dotstar library supports similar format natively as a raw input (bytearray) - which needs to be examined further to optimize more 


##TODO/changelog
- every .py script should contain its own changelog at the beginning

###General
- [x] Demo usage video (https://youtu.be/Ho7Xqsvebsc)
- [ ] properly licence (copyleft) our python source codes and this readme (possibly GPL3?)
- [ ] Describe the usage and workflow properly in more details ("how the hack shall I use it?!")

###Coding (Python/C)
- [x] \(since v.1.3) Dynamic pixel number (how many LED diods - "pixels" - strips have got)
- [ ] Dynamic number of strips
- [ ] Add a new method (like _setStripColor_) to the Adafruit dotstar library to allow passing the whole pixel array instead of one pixel at a time (_setPixelColor_ method)
- [ ] Implementation of the OLA (Open Lighting Architecture) library to control strips via DMX512 or Artnet
- [ ] Sending raw bytearray from Touch Designer for direct input into the library (should be faster)
- [ ] Possibility to read TXT or CSV files directly as the input data and "play them"
- [ ] Test another SPI methods for filling strips
- [ ] Add TCP/IP support (currently only UDP is supported)
- [ ] Better "throttle" variables balancing/adjusting in the Adafruit dotstar library to avoid flickering

###TouchDesigner
- [ ] Variables for number of strips and pixel count
- [ ] More efficient RGB to STRING conversion
- [ ] Graphical user interface
- [ ] Implementation of recording data into TXT or CSV file and loading them

##Usage and workflow
- connect the LED strips (APA102 5050) properly and attach all to the Raspberry Pi2. Here are HOWTOs:
  - https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds/overview
  - https://learn.adafruit.com/dotstar-pi-painter/overview (more detailed info about PINs and wiring)
- run the python script svetlo-mt.py (Rasbberry Pi2) to start the server (listening on some IP port) and process the incoming data
- run the TouchDesigner file and override the IP address accordingly to send the data
- (or optionally test with svetlo-send.py first)

Nothing of this would have be done without the [Adafruit DotStar Pi module](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DotStar_Pi)
and [Derivative Touch Designer](http://www.derivative.ca/)
