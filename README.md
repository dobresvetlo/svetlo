# svetlo
##Abstract
This is the ulti multi LED walrus crazy disco aka "svetlo"
(a project to light up some APA102 5050 LED strips using Raspberry Pi2 and Python)

##About
_Svetlo_ means _light_ in Czech. The aim of this project is to design an open-source simplest, fastest and cheapest way to drive digital LED strips via Raspberry PI from a video source. To subtitute hardware for hundreds of Euros with a cheaper one with an open-source code.
There are two reasons we are using STRING FORMAT (0xffffff with a | divider) of data over UDP/IP:
- in the future it could be easily stored and read from a file (e.g. CSV)
- the Adafruit C library supports similar format natively as a raw input (bytearray) 


##TODO and changelog
###Python
- [x] Dynamic pixel number
- [ ] Describe the usage and workflow properly in more details ("how the hack shall I use it?!")
- [ ] Dynamic number of strips
- [ ] Add a method to the Adafruit library to allow submitting the whole array of pixels instead of one pixel at a time
- [ ] Implementation of the OLA (Open Lighting Architecture) library to control strips via DMX512 or Artnet
- [ ] Sending raw bytearray from Touch Designer for direct input into the library (should be faster)
- [ ] Possibility to read TXT or CSV files directly as the input data and "play them"
- [ ] Test another SPI methods for filling the strips
- [ ] Add TCP/IP support (currently only UDP is supported)
- [ ] Better balancing of the "throttle" variables in the Adafruit library to avoid flickering

###TouchDesigner
- [ ] Variables for number of strips and pixel count
- [ ] More efficient RGB to STRING conversion
- [ ] Graphical user interface
- [ ] Implementation of recording data into TXT or CSV file and loading them

##Usage and workflow
- connect the LED strips (APA102 5050) properly and attach all to the Raspberry Pi2 - see the [Adafruit tutorial here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds/overview/)
- run the python script svetlo-mt.py (Rasbberry Pi2) to listen and process the incoming data
- run the TouchDesigner file and override the IP address accordingly to send the data
- (or optionally test with svetlo-send.py first)

Nothing of this would be done without the [Adafruit DotStar Pi module](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DotStar_Pi)
and [Derivative Touch Designer](http://www.derivative.ca/)
