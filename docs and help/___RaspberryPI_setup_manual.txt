---------------------------

Instalation RaspberryPI and Dotstar Libraries 

- install system Raspbian on a micro SD card (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)
- get it running
- possible to use Raspberry with a) monitor, mouse and keyboard or b) via SSH protocol remotely (recomended)

a) with monitor mouse and keyboard skip b)
	- log in (password "raspberry")
	- connect to a wifi or a cable, open a terminal ('Command' + T), skip b) and follow next steps

b) via SSH (remotely from a Terminal)
	- to allow SSH on RaspberryPI, make file called SSH on a Raspberry root system disk
	- connect RaspberryPI using UTP cable
	- open Terminal (on WIndows you can use Cygwin)

	BASH: (bash is a unix command shell - Terminal)
		ssh pi@<RASPBERRY_IP_ADRESS> (could be found in your router UI, it is good to Bind IP adress to your RaspberryPI MAC adress to stay similar)
		- after prompting password use "raspberry"
		sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
		(sudo is gives command superuser rights - password will be requested; nano is basic text editor)
		- add the “network” section shown here, changing the network name and password to match your setup (be precise with spaces etc., this code should be exact for proper work):

    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1
    network={
    	ssid="my-network-name"
    	psk="my-network-password"
    	scan_ssid=1
    }

    	- reboot RaspberryPi
    	- via Terminal connect with 
    	BASH:
    		ssh pi@<RASPBERRY_IP_ADRESS> (eg. 192.168.1.15)

BASH: 
	sudo raspi-config (Interfacing options > allow SPI; allow Expand System)
	(configuring board)
	
	sudo apt-get update
	(this will update repositories for installing)
	
	sudo apt-get install git python-dev python-pip
	(ínstalling GIT - distributed version system, python-dev - Python development kit, PIP - python package management system)

	cd /home
	(go to your home folder)
	
	sudo git clone https://github.com/dobresvetlo/svetlo
	(cloning repository DOBRE SVETLO from Github)

	cd /home/svetlo
	(go to cloned folder)

- eventually for copying and managing files use WinSCP, Filezilla or other SCP client
- configure connection in WinSCP:

	Session

		File Protocol: SCP
		Host name: The IP address of you Raspberry Pi
		User name: pi
		Password: raspberry

	SCP /Shell

		Shell: sudo su – (if you want to be able to write to protected directories, e.g. /var/ww/ to transfer files for apache web server) 

- lets start, everyone likes rainbow chase, and test your hardware and software setup

BASH:

	sudo nano /home/svetlo/strandtest.py
	(edit output pins and lenght of your testing APA102 strip)

	sudo python /home/svetlo/strandtest.py
	(LED should start making rainbow chase)


////// DOBRE SVETLO //////

BASH:
	- edit output pins, stripcount and lenght of your LED strip
	sudo nano /home/Adafruit_DotStar_Pi/svetlo.py
	
	- run DOBRE SVETLO
	sudo python /home/svetlo/strandtest.py
	(program should wait for data)

- run TouchDesigner to send some data and update output IP and pixelcount matching Raspberry's

BLINK!

- Raspberry PI 3B 
	(Depends on amount of LEDs and strips used - for Quad processors could be used multithreading code)
- Breadboard (Full sized)
- Quad Level-Shifter (3V to 5V) (74AHCT125 or similar, For each 2 LED strips
